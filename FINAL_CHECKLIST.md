Subject: ZenRows Fullstack Assessment - [Your Name]

Hi [Interviewer Name],

I've completed the ZenRows scraper configuration MVP assessment.

Project Repository: [GitHub link]
OR
Project ZIP: [Download link]

Tech Stack: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase
Time Spent: ~4 hours

Key Features:
‚úÖ Google OAuth authentication
‚úÖ Origin/Destination pairing with visual feedback
‚úÖ Multiple saved combinations with persistence
‚úÖ Delete functionality
‚úÖ Fully Dockerized
‚úÖ Figma design implementation

Quick Start:
1. Follow SETUP_GUIDE.md (5 minutes)
2. Or use Docker (see README.md)

Notes:
- Chose Next.js over Laravel+Vue for simplicity and ease of review
- Database setup script included (database_setup.sql)
- All dummy buttons are non-functional as per requirements
- Code is intentionally simple and well-documented for easy extension

I'm happy to discuss any technical decisions or extend features during the next round.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

1. **Don't commit `.env.local`** - It contains sensitive keys
2. **Test Docker before submitting** - Ensure it builds and runs
3. **Include env.example** - So interviewer knows what vars are needed

5. **Production Patterns**: RLS, proper auth, security
6. **Figma-Accurate**: Visual match to design
7. **Extensible**: Clear path for future features

## üìù Optional Improvements (If Time)

- [ ] Add TypeScript (rename to .tsx, add types)

- [ ] Add loading skeletons
- [ ] Add error toast notifications
- [ ] Add animation to selection state
- [ ] Add search/filter for origins/destinations
